# hello-world
To begin using a github repo, I just save  my dotfiles here.

Futureplans are:

To develop a keymap for the ergodox-keyboard for the field of indologie
  - being able to type diffrent font-scripts (like devanagari, sinhala, thai, roman) 
    without changing the keymapsettings.
  - build even a more ergonomic keyboard based on the idea of the ergodox.
  
Enter deeper the vim-script to  
  - extent vim, to be able displaying devanagari-script proper (not yet so far I am informed)    

so far so good, but guess it will take time.
